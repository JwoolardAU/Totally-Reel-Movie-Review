# Totally-Reel-Movie-Review
For our project we want to create a movie review site that anyone can join and create an account for. The site will showcase numerous movie pages that users will be able to leave their reviews and thoughts on to discuss with other site users. If you would like to see our work, please watch this demonstration video https://youtu.be/5Mb_5Xfnxb0
